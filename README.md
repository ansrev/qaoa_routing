# Quantum Computing for Routing Use Cases
Quantum computing has significant potential for uses in optimization. This BA thesis (written 2021) is about applications of quantum computing for routing use cases, with focus on the algorithms QAOA and VQE.
It is based on the use cases formulated by Daniel Jaroszewski, Fabian Klos, and Benedikt Sturm in the 2020 paper "Ising formulations of routing optimization problems":

The supervisors for the thesis were Dr. Jan-Rainer Lahmann (IBM) and Dr. Carmen Winter (DHBW Stuttgart). 

This repo contains the thesis pdf, the implementation source code for the different use cases (Python), and presentation slides that summarize the work and results.
